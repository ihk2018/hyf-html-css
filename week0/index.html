                <p> Born in Spain in 1986, <strong> <em>Rafael Nadal</em></strong> began playing tennis at age three and
                    turned pro at 15. Known as the <em>"King of Clay"</em> for his skill playing on clay courts, as well
                    as his topspin-heavy shots and tenacity, Nadal has won a record 12 French Open singles titles and
                    ranks second all time in the men's game with 18 Grand Slam titles.</p><br>
                <p>Despite enduring shoulder and foot injuries, Nadal won his second straight French Open and added four
                    more titles in 2006. After Wimbledon, Nadal's winning streak stood at a career-best 32 matches. With
                    his powerful topspin-heavy shots, speed and mental toughness, Nadal reigned as one of the "Big Four"
                    of men's tennis (along with Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray) for the next several years. He
                    took over as the world's No. 1 in 2008, and won his first Australian Open in 2009. In 2010, he was
                    triumphant at the French Open and Wimbledon, and his subsequent win at the U.S. Open made him just
                    the second men's player to achieve the career Golden Slam â€” victories at all four majors, as well as
                    Olympic gold.</p> <br>
                <p>The 2018 French Open brought more of the same from its most decorated player, with Nadal making
                    mincemeat of his competition. The final against No. 7 seed Dominic Thiem presented an interesting
                    matchup, as the big-hitting Austrian had defeated Nadal on clay a month earlier, but the Spaniard
                    rolled to a straight set victory for a remarkable 11th French singles crown and his 17th overall
                    Grand Slam championship.
                    Nadal advanced to the semifinals of the following two Grand Slams, but was forced from the latter
                    with a knee problem and then underwent ankle surgery in November. He recovered to make a run to the
                    2019 Australian Open final, and then overcame more nagging injuries to reestablish his clay-court
                    dominance that spring, culminating with a four-set win over Thiem for his <em>12th French Open
                        crown</em>.</p>
